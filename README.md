# PF-MAAC:

## Overview:
This work investigates the multi-robot efficient search problem with a focus on maximizing the probability of capturing a moving target within a predefined time constraint. PF-MAAC serves as a lightweight solution aligned with probabilistic theory, specifically designed to handle the complexities of the maximal capture probability objective. PF-MAAC is composed of:
1. A generalized temporal difference (GTD) module to establish the temporal-difference relationship of the central value function,
2. A probability-based factorization (P-FAC) module to decompose the central value function into individual ones in a probability-compliant manner, and
3. An extended policy gradient (EPG) module which updates each robotâ€™s actor-network based on the decomposed individual value function.
